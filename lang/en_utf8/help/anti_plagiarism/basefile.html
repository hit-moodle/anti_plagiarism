<h1>Base File</h1>

<p>Moss normally reports all code that matches in pairs of files. When a base file is supplied, program code that also appears in the base file is not counted in matches. A typical base file will include, for example, the instructor-supplied code for an assignment. If you have multiple base files, merge them as one. Base files improve results, but are not usually necessary for obtaining useful information.</p>
